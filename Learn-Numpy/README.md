# Content Description
**Note: The content in this folder will be updated often, it's by no means the fixed final version**

This folder includes simple tutorials of how to use ensential python libraries in data science. It will cover some tips on using **Numpy**, **Pandas**, **Scipy**. Basic plots drawing in **Matplotlib** will also be included.

## Numpy
This is the basis for Data Science. The central object in Numpy is the numpy array, you can use numpy array to do vector and matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Of course, we can do a lot more more complicated matrix operations, like products, inverses, determinants, and solving linear systems.

## Pandas
Pandas is great because it does a lot of things under the hood, which makes the data preprocess and data manipulation proccess much easier. The central object in Pandas is the DataFrame. 

## Scipy
Scipy is like an addon library to Numpy. Whereas Numpy provides basic building blocks, like vectors, matrices, and operations on them, Scipy uses those general building blocks to do specific things. For example, Scipy can do many common statistics calculations, including getting the PDF value, the CDF value, sampling from a distribution, and statistical testing.


## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is used for data visualization in python.
