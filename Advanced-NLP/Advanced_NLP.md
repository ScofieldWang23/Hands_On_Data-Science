## Description
This folder is mainly for holding `notebooks` and `.py` files for learning Advanced NLP techniques with Deep Learning.

You'll learn how to build applications using Advanced NLP approaches for problems like:

- `text classification` (examples are `sentiment analysis` and `spam detection`)
- `neural machine translation`
- `question answering`

We'll also take a brief look at `chatbots` and as you’ll learn in this section, this problem is actually no different from `machine translation` and `question answering`.

To solve these problems, we’re going to cover some advanced Deep NLP techniques, such as:
- `bidirectional RNNs`
- `seq2seq` (sequence-to-sequence)
- `attention`
- `memory networks`
